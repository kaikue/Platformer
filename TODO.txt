Polish:
	Don't show slime when you can't place it (bouncing up in boss fight phase 3)
	Walking just barely off the edge will cause wrong wallslide image (facing left but back against wall to right)
	Set jump anim instead of slide right after leaving wall, not after grace period
	Outline on star # GUI (white text, dark outline)
	Prevent fall star -> pit star sequence break
	Add more stuff to top left of crystal level (move top section to left and don't let them climb above it?)
	Zoom in to star when approaching (then zoom out after collected)
	Slime appears in cutscene when collecting last star in hub?
	Remove signs, replace with floating text
		Gamepad controls too
	Keyboard/gamepad support for menus
	Freeze for a bit on hit then flicker after respawning
	Checkpoint notification?
	Make boss faster
	More stars?
		climb up wall with walljump + slime
		horizontal fireball run
		fall -> walljump
	Remove N cheat
	Walljump (+ regular jump) grace period 0.25 seconds
	Variable jump height?
	Slow when sliding down walls? (only when moving down)
		also only do slide image when moving down?
		slide particles?
		Wallslide sound
			test with corners in boss level (2 tilesets)

Walljump mechanics
	Trigger: press jump key when against wall
		hold towards wall?
		hold away from wall?
		not if last jumped against that side in midair?
	Effect: jump up (vertical)
	Effect: push away from wall (horizontal)
		push declines over time?
		push suddenly stops after brief window?
		push is only impulse?
		push continues if no movement key pressed?
	Consequences:
		can jump back and forth up narrow vertical corridor
		can climb single vertical wall?

camera 2/3 down?

Scene transition (to particular point in scene)

Player can jump ~3 units

Art notes:
	Be sure to set NUM_RUN_FRAMES and NUM_ROLL_FRAMES to the correct values
	Default sprite facing is left (remove - in facing calculation if not)
	Wall slide sprite should face opposite of other sprites

	When changing player dimensions, update bounding box and fully retest level design

Level design notes:
	Player should visit doors before being able to open them
	Use scenery to draw attention to offscreen stuff

	Jump-roll for extra air distance
	Jump-roll-jump for controlled distance
	Jump-roll-jump (hold direction) for maximum distance
	Walljump-roll backwards to climb over a lip
