	Background/outline on star # GUI
	Prevent fall star -> pit star sequence break
	Add more stuff to top left of crystal level (move top section to left and don't let them climb above it?)

Art notes:
	Be sure to set NUM_RUN_FRAMES and NUM_ROLL_FRAMES to the correct values
	Default sprite facing is left (remove - in facing calculation if not)
	Wall slide sprite should face opposite of other sprites
	Star should be white, colored by material
	When changing player dimensions, update bounding box and fully retest level design

Level design notes:
	Player should visit doors before being able to open them
	Use scenery to draw attention to offscreen stuff

Cool moves:
	Jump-roll for extra air distance
	Jump-roll-jump for controlled distance
	Jump-roll-jump (hold direction) for maximum distance
